      <h1>Factoriole API Documentation</h1>
      
      <p>
        Factoriole provides a simple JSON-based REST API for developers to incorporate facts into Apps.
        The individual resources are detailed below.
        To keep things simple, all API transactions are limited to 100 requests per fifteen minutes.
        Check the documentation regularly. This API is quite young and is subject to considerable change at this time.
      </p>

      <div class="resource">
        <h2>/facts</h2>
        <div class="method">
          <h3>GET</h3>
          <p>
            Returns an array of summarized facts using query parameters as the basis for search.
            (More detail can be acquired by querying the facts individually using /facts/:id described below.)
            If active=false is not included in the query parameters, only active facts will be displayed.
            Note that inactive facts are inactive for a reason: they are probably incorrect--
            so use them at your own peril.
            Each request will only return a max of 25 facts, but you may request fewer by using the limit=# query parameter.
            You may use since=# and until=# query parameters to select facts by the time they were added to the database,
            where # is a Unix timestamp.
            You may also search by tags=$, where $ is a searchable tag. All facts have four searchable tags.
            You may search by three tags per query;
            you can list multiple tags by simply using the tags=$ query parameter repeatedly.
          </p>

                You must provide at least one source, and that one source must have the citationMLA field filled in.
                If you do not provide valid MLA citation in this field, the fact will be found and disabled by an administrator.
                Repeated offenses will result in account deactivation.
                You may also provide the publicationTime field, which takes a Unix timestamp,
                an organization field, which takes the source's organization, such as 'Bureau of Justic Statistics',
                and an authors field, which takes the names of the source's authors in an array of strings.
